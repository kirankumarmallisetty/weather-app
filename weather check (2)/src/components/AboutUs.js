        Having up-to-date information about the weather helps us to take
        well-read decisions. These weather apps constantly update the forecasts
        for a day or hour, or sometimes for even a minute. These can be simply
        termed as the compact weather devices, as they do not only tell about
        the temperature of that specific region instead they can describe the
        accurate time of the sunrise and sunset, the time of the rainfall,
        humidity levels, etc.
